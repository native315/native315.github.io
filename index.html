<h2>How it works</h2>
<hr>
<h3>This is a student run website. The teachers or the school don't know about this. So be secretive.</h3>
 <ol>
  <li>Me and some other people will scatter qr codes around the school. In the bathrooms, some classrooms, you name it, there is probably a qr code there.</li>
  <li>Next, you guys find the qr code. You take it home, to then scan it on your phone.</li>
  <li>Lastly, you fill out the form, consisting of place you found it, your gender, (this is so we can place it in the right bathroom.) and your discord username. (so we can tell you where we put it)</li>
   <li>Now, go to the bathroom we tell you to, and find your reward. Go as soon as possible to get it, or else it may be stolen.</li>
</ol>
<p>This page of the website doesn't do anything, it only gets useful when you fill out the form.</p>
<p>We are not responsible for any lost rewards. If anything you should be paying us!</p>
<hr>
<p>I do not feel comfortable with disclosing who is in charge of this website, so that's for you to figure out. Thank you!</p>
<p>I know i am acting all secretive about this, but seriously, i don't want to get in trouble for doing this. so if you know who i am, then don't rat me out. send me a message and i may stop.</p>
<p>FIRST DROP: 9/27</p>
