        <h3>Radio Discord Bot</h3>
        <p>bot that lets you play live music from any radio station in the world. uses the radio garden api. (written in python)</p>

        <h1>PROJECT: 3</h1>
        <h3>resources for hacking into the school network. (not really a project but)</h3>
        <p>a list of resources i used to abuse the vulnerabilities. every computer in my school had the SSH port opened and the VNC port opened. if you are smarter than my tech teacher you can guess what i did with that.</p>
        <p>first, i bypassed the firewall by initiating this website. i installed the .dmg for vncviewer (because it's blocked on my schools network) and i put it on the server. here's the install link:</p>
        <a href="projects/VNCVIEWER.dmg">VNCVIEWER.dmg</a>
        <p>my school still has yet to block it, and yours probably also has this website unblocked.</p>
        <p>second, i found the admin password for every computer in the school (easier than you think, all i did was search for it on google lmao)</p>
        <p>i've also discovered that the laptops at my school blocked communication with each other between the student account. that's why i needed the admin password, so i could run commands on their computer.<br>after logging into your target computer using the admin account, you can just do sudo su student to switch to student, and then wreak havok!</p>
        <p>now the second reason i established this website was to host my own images that i can install using curl, and open on the target computer using the open command.</p>

        <p>this website was made by native315 with CSS help from ChatGPT (I am a high school student after all)</p>
        <p>my projects are not under any license. use them as you will. i really could not care less.</p>
